# 🌍 What is Humanity Chain?

Humanity Chain is an experimental open verification protocol designed for the AI era.

The project focuses on:

- content integrity
- traceability
- transparent verification
- provenance records
- digital fingerprint systems
- multi-source witness workflows

Humanity Chain explores how digital content may become more verifiable in increasingly synthetic online environments.

---

# 🛡️ Why Does It Exist?

Modern internet content is becoming harder to verify.

Challenges include:

- deepfakes
- synthetic media
- manipulated content
- anonymous redistribution
- unverifiable archives
- AI-generated misinformation

Humanity Chain attempts to build transparent verification infrastructure for digital records.

---

# 🧩 What is HC://?

HC:// is a conceptual digital fingerprint protocol.

The protocol may provide:

- SHA-256 fingerprints
- timestamps
- verification metadata
- optional QR verification
- optional witness references

If content changes, its fingerprint changes.

---

# ⚙️ Verification Layers

## Layer 1 — HC:// Core

Basic integrity and fingerprint layer.

Possible components:

- SHA-256 hash
- timestamp
- record ID
- traceability metadata

---

## Layer 2 — Integrity Verification

Verifies whether content still matches its original fingerprint.

---

## Layer 3 — Witness Layer

Optional human or AI-assisted review layer.

Possible witness systems:

- human reviewers
- AI analysis systems
- multi-model comparisons
- independent validators

---

## Layer 4 — Multi-Witness Verification

Multiple independent witnesses may review records or verification claims.

---

# ⚠️ What HC:// Does NOT Do

Humanity Chain does not claim:

- absolute truth verification
- legal authority
- government certification
- automatic factual correctness
- perfect authenticity detection
- ideological judgment

HC:// focuses on integrity, traceability, and transparent verification workflows.

---

# 🌐 Open Protocol Vision

Humanity Chain is designed as an open protocol concept.

The long-term goal is to explore interoperable verification systems for digital content.

Potential future integrations may include:

- archives
- media systems
- social platforms
- AI systems
- educational systems
- public verification services

---

# 🤖 AI Witness Layer

The AI witness layer is optional.

Possible functions may include:

- manipulation analysis
- synthetic media indicators
- deepfake risk analysis
- verification assistance
- multi-model review

AI witness systems are experimental and may produce uncertainty or errors.

---

# 📜 Content Responsibility

Responsibility for uploaded or published content remains with:

- publishers
- platforms
- uploaders
- original content owners

Humanity Chain provides verification infrastructure, not content ownership.

---

# 🚧 Project Status

Current status:

- experimental protocol draft
- early-stage architecture development
- open repository structure
- verification workflow research
- digital fingerprint experiments

---

# 🤝 Contributing

Constructive feedback, documentation improvements, protocol discussions, and security-focused contributions are welcome.

# 🔧 Technical v1 Core

Humanity Chain now includes a working verification protocol core with the following components:

## What's Available

| Component | Type | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `schema/record-v1.schema.json` | JSON Schema | Record format validation |
| `src/hash.py` | Tool | SHA256 fingerprint generator |
| `src/validator.py` | Tool | Record validation |
| `src/qr.py` | Tool | QR code generation |
| `docs/verification-workflow.md` | Documentation | Complete workflow guide |
| `examples/` | Records | 3 example records (AI, Human, Multi) |
| `requirements.txt` | Dependencies | Python package requirements |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Validate example records
python src/validator.py examples/ai_witness_example.json
python src/validator.py examples/human_witness_example.json
python src/validator.py examples/multi_model_example.json

# Calculate hash
python src/hash.py examples/ai_witness_example.json

# Generate QR code
python src/qr.py HC-CHATGPT-2026-0001 <hash> records/verified/HC-CHATGPT-2026-0001.md
```

## Record States

- **draft** → Initial, editable, no validation
- **reviewed** → Reviewed by witness, issues noted
- **verified** → Approved, hash locked
- **archived** → Permanent, immutable

See `docs/verification-workflow.md` for complete workflow details.
