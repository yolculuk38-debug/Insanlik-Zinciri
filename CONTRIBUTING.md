- Open documentation
- Constructive collaboration

---

## Record Standards

When submitting a new interaction record:

- Use clear and consistent formatting.

## Pull Request Merge Policy (Security-First)

Humanity Chain uses a **security-first default** for pull requests:

- PRs are treated as **manual-review required** unless they are clearly documentation-only.
- PRs that touch code, schemas, automation/workflows, source, or tooling paths are labeled `manual-review` and must be reviewed by a maintainer before merge.

### Docs-Only Auto-Merge

Documentation-only pull requests are eligible for automatic merge:

- Eligible PRs are labeled `docs-auto`.
- Auto-merge is enabled only after GitHub required checks pass.
- Merge method is squash merge.

### Manual Review Triggers

Any PR that changes sensitive or executable surfaces is labeled `manual-review`, including but not limited to:

- `src/`
- `schema/`
- `.github/workflows/`
- `tools/`
- dependency/runtime files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `VERSION`)

If there is uncertainty, the policy defaults to `manual-review`.
