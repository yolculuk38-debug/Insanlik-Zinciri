# Humanity Chain Architecture

## Overview

Humanity Chain is structured as a layered archival and verification protocol.

The system is designed to support transparent records, traceable verification workflows, and long-term archive integrity.

---

## Core Layers

### 1. Record Layer

Stores interaction records between humans and AI systems.

Directory:

records/

Examples:

- Human-AI interaction logs
- Verification records
- Structured archive entries

---

### 2. Hash Verification Layer

Stores SHA-256 hash references related to archived records.

Directory:

hash/

Purpose:

- Integrity verification
- Tamper detection
- Reference consistency

---

### 3. QR Verification Layer

Stores QR-related references and access verification structures.

Directory:

qr/

Purpose:

- Rapid archive access
- Mobile verification workflows
- External reference linking

---

### 4. Timeline Layer

Stores chronological archive references and event tracking.

Directory:

timeline/

Purpose:

- Historical traceability
- Event sequencing
- Archive chronology

---

### 5. Governance Layer

Stores documentation related to project rules and collaboration standards.

Directory:

docs/

Includes:

- Governance
- Contribution standards
- Conduct rules
- Protocol documentation

---

## Verification Workflow

Basic workflow example:

1. Interaction is recorded.
2. Record is archived.
3. Hash reference is generated.
4. Timeline entry is created.
5. QR reference may be attached.
6. Witness references may be added.
7. Record becomes verifiable.

## Experimental Status

Humanity Chain is an experimental protocol design.

Architecture, workflows, and verification standards may evolve over time.
